# prospector-solitaire

This is the classic card game of solitaire, but with twists on scoring. The longer your run of cards, the faster your score increases. Also, your score builds cumulatively between rounds. Finally, there's use of Bezier curves for smooth interpolations on the UI. Here is an example image of gameplay:

# motivation

I am going through Jeremy Gibson's <i>Game Design, Prototyping, and Development</i> textbook and building the prototypes he gives the reader to do. This is the fourth prototype.
